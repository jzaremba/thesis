Spatially-tuned Ca\super{2+} transients {Dombeck, 2010 #309} (Fig. 2c) were detected in both WT and \emph{Df(16)A\super{+/-}}, mice however we found that the fraction of identified neurons that exhibited place cell place cell properties was about 25$\%$ less in \emph{Df(16)A\super{+/-}} mice...
-Should be 2007

This assumption allows us to empirically calculate the false positive rate for each putative event, and thus identify a duration and amplitude threshold above which an event has a fixed (95$\%$) minimum false-positive rate...
