Spatially-tuned Ca\super{2+} transients {Dombeck, 2010 #309} (Fig. 2c) were detected in both WT and \emph{Df(16)A\super{+/-}}, mice however we found that the fraction of identified neurons that exhibited place cell place cell properties was about 25$\%$ less in \emph{Df(16)A\super{+/-}} mice...
-Should be 2007

This assumption allows us to empirically calculate the false positive rate for each putative event, and thus identify a duration and amplitude threshold above which an event has a fixed (95$\%$) minimum false-positive rate...
- Should be 5%

- Fix Skaggs reference

We detected statistically significant calcium transients as previously described \citep{Dombeck2007}\citep{Lovett-Barron2014}.
- delete, next section goes into detail.

LFP signals from a 4-channel silicon probe (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor) centered around the \emph{stratum pyramidale} layer of CA1 were recorded
- change to stratum pyramidale

recording site was chosen based on the amplitude of LFP ripple-events
- lower-case ripple

In order to detect Sharp-Wave/Ripple events, the pyramidal layer LFP's were band-pass filtered at the Ripple-band frequency 
- lower-case SWR
