* Check all Hollup references (fixed one in discussion already)
* Klausberger2008b key in bibtex?
* Add Nathan's mossy cell paper at least to the methods
* 50 page intro
* Horizontal licktograms
* Fix Dupret figure.

\todo[color=blue]{You can add some conclusion  sentences to here. Try to make it more integral part of the theses. Refer back to intro part on heterogenetiy and come back to this briefly in the conclusion/future direction  -- you can try to link e.g. the developmetnal origin of SCZ with the developmetnal pattering of superficial-deep cells that it would good to look at in the future (NB: SAS will likely ask about that anyway: CA2-deep CA1, did you look at sublayer differences, what would you expect, etc -- so it would be nice to add something about it as future directions and link the two works)}


Conclusion/Future Direction: SCZ memory deficit beyond hippocampus systems concept: al-
tered afferent-efferent information flow - from/to HPC: a. MEC/LEC- maybe altered? - good
link to the Basu paper at least for the inhibitory inputs! b. THALAMUS - especially the RE-
UNIENS!! -evidence see in i. Excitation, inhibition, local oscillations, or large-scale loops:
what causes the symptoms of schizophrenia? Lisman review 2012, see Fig in that review. ii.
A thalamo-hippocampal-ventral tegmental area loop may produce the positive feedback that
underlies the psychotic break in schizophrenia. Lisman JE, Pi HJ, Zhang Y, Otmakhova NA.
(NB: I think Christoph K will want to see something about this and/or he would ask into this.
So it is beter to have it in) a. mPFC: you should recap the manuscript discussion (altered func-
tional coupling, theta, SPW-R, WM deficit. The final point could be is that all these afferent
and efferent inputs lend themselves for in vivo imaging axonal projections.
